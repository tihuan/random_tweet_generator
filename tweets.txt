I dream of a world without war, without poverty and without girls who post sexy selfies with unrelated inspirational quote captions.

Karaoke is listening to your favorite song become your least favorite song.

Nothing has ever annoyed me while also satisfying me like detangling a necklace.

I dream of a world where everyone knows that Gi makes a J sound. ‪http://instagram.com/p/m5aEaJvv5O/‬

Hey, Austin! Remember when I was there in November? My opener from that week, ‪@GiuliaRozzi‬, is headlining ‪@CapCityComedy‬ all week! Go to it.

Can the IRS "Where's My Refund" tracker also tell me where my period is?

I don't feel like telling you what I'm thinking.

‪@GrubHub‬ this could be like the new version of The Bachelor, instead of giving out roses he gives out containers of Pad Thai.

I wish GrubHub was a service that delivered potential husbands to my house to cook me dinner.

Last time I was at ‪@CapCityComedy‬ I unknowingly flashed my boobs, let's see what magic happens tonight-Sat! ‪https://cap-city-comedy-club.seatengine.com/venues/cap-city-comedy-club/events/4092/shows …‬

In case it's not obvious, I'm watching The Simpsons. At a laundry mat. Stoned.

Bart Simpson shouldn't be allowed to have that many catchphrases.

I get that Bart Simpson's "thing" is saying "Ay Caramba" but like, okay we get it.

Austin, I'm headlining ‪@CapCityComedy‬ this week 4/16-4/19! ‪@MaryRadzinski‬ is joining me! Let's get high & eat BBQ! ‪https://cap-city-comedy-club.seatengine.com/venues/cap-city-comedy-club/events/4092/shows …‬

I hate this weather, everyone in the Northeast is acting like they just got sent back to prison.

iPhone autocorrected "left you a vm" to "left you a bm." Not cool iPhone, not cool.

Gonna live Tweet this book I'm pretending to read.

It's weird that my boyfriend hasn't called me in a while considering that my boyfriend is my iPhone.

I love this weather, everyone in the Northeast is acting like they just got out of prison.

I'm addickted to boners

‪@janinebrito‬ uhhhh or big upside!

My niece drew me doing stand-up  ‪http://instagram.com/p/mvKBvOPv8p/‬

One of my favorite things about staying with my parents for a week is seeing how long I can let my leg hair can grow.

Palm Sunday Funday!

‪@coreymanning‬ ‪@LaughBoston‬ you are a delight!!!

One good thing about being a man is you can just have a favorite sports team and that's your entire personality

The first half of all big Italian get-togethers is just people arguing about who sits where.

People who respond to "I love you" by saying "I love you more" are way too competitive.

Sometimes I worry that the lady Silk offered to "lick up and down" in the 1992 hit Freak Me still hasn't said "stop."

I feel sexually harassed by the word harASSment.

I want to name my bong "wife" so I can say "toke my wife, please."

My train car smelled like salami which made me excited until I realized it wasn't salami.
